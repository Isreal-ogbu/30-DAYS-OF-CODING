Reverse order.

Write a function that takes a string as input, and returns a string similar to the input, but with the words in reverse order, and the punctuation marks maintaining their original order.

E.G:

f("Hello. I'm Edwin A.J, and you?") => "You and. A.J Edwin I'm, Hello?"

f("What time is it? Hammer time.") => "Time Hammer? It is time what."

 

Note: As shown in the example above, the order of the punctuation marks("?", "," , ".") have not changed. Only the words have.
