Day 13: What are the acronyms?

    Write a program that does the following:

*Ask the user to enter(input()) a sentence containing an acronym or more.

*Print out a list containing all acronyms in the sentence.

For example:

*Input: "I need to get this done ASAP."; Output–> ["ASAP"]

*Input: "SMH. The NPF is really a joke!"; Output–> ["SMH", "NPF"]

*Input: "LOOOL. I thought you were at KFC"; Output–> ["LOOOL", "KFC"]

(Note: An "acronym", for our purposes, 
is defined as any continuous sequence of UPPERCASE LETTERS,
not srparated by a whitespace or a symbol.)
