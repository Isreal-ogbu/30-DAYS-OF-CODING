Student or Professor.

At a certain school, student email addresses end with @student.college.edu,
while professor email addresses end with @prof.college.edu.
Write a program that first asks the user how many email addresses they will be entering,
and then has the user enter those addresses. After all the email addresses are entered,
the program should print out a message indicating exactly how many student and professor emails were entered.
