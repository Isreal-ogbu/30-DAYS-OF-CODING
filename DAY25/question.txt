Binary search algorithm.

    "Binary search" is a basic algorithm, used to find the position of a target value within an SORTED LIST.

(More details can be found here: Binary search)

   For today's task, write a function that takes in two parameters: One list of alphabets, and one character to search. E.G f("x", ['m', 'v', 'x', 'u'])

In your function:

1)first check if the input list is sorted, using any method of your preference. ( If it's unsorted, return a warning indicating so, else continue)

2) Using the BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM, find the position of the input character in the sorted list.

3)return the position of the character  in the search list. 

4) If the character is not found, return false
