Countdown Timer. 

   Write a program that:

1) Asks the user to enter a time period in the form of a number with a unit of either seconds, minutes, or hours. (E.G "44s", "32m", "10h".) 

*the last character of the string entered would be used to determine its unit.

2) Counts down from the input value, and prints out the time left on the clock every second.

3) When the time is exhausted, makes a beeping sound non-stop until the user exits the app. 

 

For example:

T>Enter a time

User> 5s

T>5 seconds left

>4 seconds left

>3 seconds left

>2 seconds left

>1 second left

*continuous indefinite beeping*

 

(Hint: A "beeping sound" can be achieved using the "bell character", or any library of your choice.)
