A Magic Square is a 3*3 grid, such that: 

It contains ALL the numbers 1 through 9

The sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal all add up to the same number.

In a program, you can simulate a magic square using a two-dimensional list.

 

*Write a function that accepts a two-dimensional list as input, and determines 

whether the list is a Magic Square or not. Test the function in a program.
