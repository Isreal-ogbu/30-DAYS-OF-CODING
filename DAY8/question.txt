Caesar Cipher
 

A Caesar cipher is an ancient form of encryption. It involved taking a text(a string) as input,
 and encoding it by replacing each letter by the one n-steps  next to it in the alphabet. 
(E.G Shifting "Python" by 5, becomes "Udymts".â€”Note that this "shift", wraps around, which is why "y" becomes "d".).

Task: 

"Write a function that takes in as parameters, a plaintext( string)to encode, and a _shift value _, and outputs the encoded value of the string.

*Write another similar function that takes in the encoded string, with a shift_value, and decodes it.


*Finally, write a third function that takes in a text, a shift value, 
and a third parameter to indicate whether to encode or decode the given text.
(I.e f("string", 5, True/false) ) , And print out the encoded(or decoded) text accordingly.
