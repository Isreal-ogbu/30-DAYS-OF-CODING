USSD Bank Service 

 

Task: Create a mock USSD service that takes user input, and provides appropriate response.

    Description:

*User provides a USSD code as input

*User can then choose among a list of options(with numbers), whether to check balance, send money, purchase airtime, etc.

*For check balance, the user is prompted to provide his password(hard-coded by you.). If correct, s/he is shown the balance—also hard-coded.

*For sending money, the user is prompted to choose from a selection of banks, after which he provides an account number, 
 and then an amount to send. And then a password, which if correct, would send the required amount, and deduct from account balance.


*Follow a similar scheme as sending money, for purchasing airtime—except that in this case, the user is ported for a phone number instead.
