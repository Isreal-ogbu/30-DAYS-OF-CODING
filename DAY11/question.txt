Euclid's algorithm(GCD).

The GCD(Greatest Common divisor) of two numbers is the largest number by which both are divisible. E.G gcd(42, 18) is 6, 
since 6 is the highest common factor(HCFâ€”same thing as GCD) of 42 and 18.

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers  and computes their GCD using Euclid's algorithm. The process is described below:

*First, compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller one.

*Next, replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder.

*Repeat this process until the smaller number equals zero. The GCD is the last value of the larger number.
