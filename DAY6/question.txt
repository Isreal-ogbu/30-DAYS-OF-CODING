Day 6: Man in the well.

A man is stuck at the bottom of a well. Each day, he climbs up 8 metres,
 and then at night, he slips downwards by 3 metres.
Using loops(any loop of your choice), write a function to determine(and print!)
how many days it takes for him to climb out of a well of any given depth,
where the depth of the well is taken as input.

E.G: f(17)=> the well is 17 metres deep.

Day 1: climbs 8m, height=8m; slips 3m, height=8-3=5m;

Day 2: climbs 8m, height=5+8=13m; slips 3m, height= 13-3=10m

Day 3: climbs 8m, height=10+8=18m.  But 18>17. STOP.(height climbed has exceeded well depth)

Therefore, f(17)=3 days.
